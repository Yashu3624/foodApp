OPTIMISING OUR APP 
---------------------

single responsibility  principle


for each component it must have single thing to work 


Break down the code into different modules -- code will be more maintable and testible , resuable

Hooks - utility function -



Custom Hooks 

These are helper functions create them in utilities with the same name use prefic used

another hook ------

whether the users is online or offline we can show something on page

to check it we use a eventlistener - track whether it is online or offline 
just add eventlistener one time = = useEffect with empty dependencies array as it only renders one time 

we can also game like dino.

is it mandatory to use "use" in hooks ?
lib recommends use 


OPTIMISING even more 
=========================

dynamically bundling .

create few components 
    Grocery component


lazy loading - intially our page dont have Grocery page but when we click it 
has Grocery page

ON DEMAND loading only when the user go to that page

we will import like this 
    cosnt Grocery = lazy() ;

    this lazy takes a call back function 

    const Grocery = lazy() => import() ) ; 
    this import is not a regular import 
    this import takes the path of that Grocery ;

    now by doing these we make 2 bundles i.e  main bundle and Grocery bundle
